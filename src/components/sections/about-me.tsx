              I am a dedicated Full Stack Developer, driven by the passion to continuously evolve and excel in the realm of software engineering. Currently, I am on an enriching journey pursuing my Master's in Software Engineering Systems from Northeastern University, where I am honing my skills and expanding my knowledge base.

              My journey into the world of technology commenced in June 2021 when I embarked on an exciting career path with Accenture. Initially starting as a Salesforce Tester, I quickly realized my aspiration to delve deeper into development. Fueled by this motivation, I embarked on a self-learning journey, equipping myself with the necessary tools and expertise to transition seamlessly into the role of a Salesforce Developer.

              With a total of 2.5 years of valuable experience at Accenture, I have had the opportunity to tackle diverse challenges, refine my technical acumen, and cultivate a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end development.
              <br />
              Driven by a relentless pursuit of excellence, I am passionate about leveraging technology to create innovative solutions that make a meaningful impact. My portfolio showcases a culmination of my projects, highlighting my proficiency in various programming languages, frameworks, and development tools.
